        <p>
            Growing up as the child of Chinese immigrants in America, my childhood was defined by the race towards the 
            next stage of life and the tricked-down fear of falling behind-- the more I achieved and the earlier I grew up the better. 
            I looked for ways to memorialize myself in that time, whether that be collecting stuffed animals or saving old workbooks. 
            I still seek the small moments where the rush of modern capitalist American life fades. My paintings and drawings 
            detail my search for moments in which I feel time's stillness as seen through candidly affected objects 
            with past lives which have been left behind along with them-- a collection of timeless Nows.
